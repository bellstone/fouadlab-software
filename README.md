# Rat Apps

This collection of rat apps is used to analyze the behavior of rats in a research setting. There are four apps:

## Installation Instructions

### macOS

To bundle the app, cd into `platform/macOS` and run `insertResources.sh`. That will copy the four python apps into an AppleScript launcher. The resulting `Rat Apps.app` can be copied to any Mac.

After launching `Rat Apps.app`, choose "Install" to install the required python libraries. Then you can select any of the apps to be launched.
